## 2. Design role-based controller architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Create the technical architecture for controllers that will handle role-based dashboard access
### Details:
Design controller classes/components that will authenticate users, verify permissions, filter dashboard content based on roles, and implement the security model defined in subtask 1

## 3. Implement metric calculation system [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the backend system for calculating and aggregating metrics from various data sources
### Details:
Create data processing pipelines, define metric formulas, implement caching strategies, optimize query performance, and ensure accurate calculations for all dashboard metrics

## 4. Design chart visualization components [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.3
### Description: Design and implement reusable chart components for the dashboard
### Details:
Select appropriate visualization libraries, create components for different chart types (bar, line, pie, etc.), implement chart configuration options, and ensure proper data binding to the metric calculation system

## 5. Develop dashboard widget framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.4
### Description: Create a flexible widget system for organizing dashboard components
### Details:
Implement a widget container system, create widget configuration options, enable drag-and-drop functionality, develop widget sizing/positioning capabilities, and ensure widgets can be saved in user layouts
