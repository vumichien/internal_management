Employees Table:**\n- `user_id` â†’ `users.id` (CASCADE update, SET NULL delete) âœ…\n- `manager_id` â†’ `employees.id` (CASCADE update, SET NULL delete) âœ…\n- Allows employee records to persist even if user account is deleted\n\n**3. Projects Table:**\n- `customer_id` â†’ `customers.id` (CASCADE update, SET NULL delete) âœ…\n- `project_manager_id` â†’ `employees.id` (CASCADE update, SET NULL delete) âœ…\n- Projects remain accessible even if customer/manager relationships change\n\n**4. Customers Table:**\n- `assigned_sales_rep` â†’ `employees.id` (CASCADE update, SET NULL delete) âœ…\n- Customer records persist independently\n\n**5. Vendors Table:**\n- `assigned_procurement_rep` â†’ `employees.id` (CASCADE update, SET NULL delete) âœ…\n- Vendor records persist independently\n\n**6. Project Assignments Table:**\n- `project_id` â†’ `projects.id` (CASCADE update, CASCADE delete) âœ…\n- `employee_id` â†’ `employees.id` (CASCADE update, CASCADE delete) âœ…\n- `assigned_by` â†’ `users.id` (CASCADE update, SET NULL delete) âœ…\n- `approved_by` â†’ `users.id` (CASCADE update, SET NULL delete) âœ…\n- Assignments are deleted when project/employee is deleted (business logic)\n\n**7. Time Entries Table:**\n- `employee_id` â†’ `employees.id` (CASCADE update, CASCADE delete) âœ…\n- `project_id` â†’ `projects.id` (CASCADE update, CASCADE delete) âœ…\n- `project_assignment_id` â†’ `project_assignments.id` (CASCADE update, SET NULL delete) âœ…\n- `approved_by` â†’ `users.id` (CASCADE update, SET NULL delete) âœ…\n- `created_by` â†’ `users.id` (CASCADE update, SET NULL delete) âœ…\n- `updated_by` â†’ `users.id` (CASCADE update, SET NULL delete) âœ…\n- `locked_by` â†’ `users.id` (CASCADE update, SET NULL delete) âœ…\n- Time entries deleted with project/employee but preserve audit trail for users\n\n**8.
