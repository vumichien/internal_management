# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement External System Integrations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate with Redmine, Google Drive, Slack, and Bitbucket APIs for seamless workflow connectivity
# Details:
1. Set up API clients for each external service
2. Implement Redmine API integration for task synchronization
3. Create Google Drive API integration for project folders
4. Build Slack API integration for notifications
5. Implement Bitbucket API for repository connections
6. Create queue jobs for background API operations
7. Add error handling and retry logic for API calls
8. Implement webhook handlers for real-time updates
9. Create configuration interface for API credentials
10. Add integration status monitoring and logging
11. Build fallback mechanisms for API failures

# Test Strategy:
Test each API integration individually, verify queue job processing, test webhook handling, validate error handling and retries, test configuration management, verify fallback mechanisms work correctly

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design API Client Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a standardized architecture for API clients that will be used across all external integrations
### Details:
Define a common interface for API clients, implement retry logic, timeout handling, and authentication mechanisms. Create a factory pattern for client instantiation. Document the architecture for future implementations.

## 2. Implement Core API Client Library [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Develop the core API client library based on the designed architecture
### Details:
Build the base API client class with common functionality like request/response handling, error normalization, logging, and metrics collection. Include rate limiting support and circuit breaker patterns.

## 3. Develop Service-Specific API Clients [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Implement API clients for each external service following the core architecture
### Details:
For each external service, create a dedicated API client that extends the core library. Implement service-specific authentication, endpoints, and data transformations. Document each client's capabilities and limitations.

## 4. Design Queue System Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design the architecture for asynchronous job processing via queues
### Details:
Define queue structure, job serialization format, retry policies, and dead-letter handling. Select appropriate queue technology and design job priority mechanisms. Create diagrams for the queue architecture.

## 5. Implement Queue Workers [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3, 10.4
### Description: Develop worker processes to handle asynchronous integration jobs
### Details:
Create worker processes that consume from the queues and process integration jobs. Implement concurrency controls, graceful shutdown, and resource management. Ensure workers can be scaled horizontally.

## 6. Develop Error Handling System [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2, 10.5
### Description: Create a comprehensive error handling and reporting system
### Details:
Implement error classification, normalization, and logging. Create retry mechanisms with exponential backoff. Develop alerting for critical failures and a dashboard for error monitoring. Implement fallback mechanisms for critical integrations.

## 7. Implement Webhook Processing Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Develop a framework for receiving and processing webhooks from external services
### Details:
Create endpoints for webhook reception, implement signature verification, and idempotency handling. Design a plugin system for webhook handlers and develop request validation. Implement webhook replay capabilities for testing.

## 8. Create Configuration Management System [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Develop a system to manage integration configurations
### Details:
Create a configuration store for API keys, endpoints, and service-specific settings. Implement encryption for sensitive data, version control for configurations, and a UI for configuration management. Support environment-specific configurations.

## 9. Implement Monitoring and Alerting [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3, 10.5, 10.7
### Description: Develop comprehensive monitoring and alerting for all integrations
### Details:
Implement metrics collection for API calls, queue depths, and processing times. Create dashboards for real-time monitoring, set up alerts for critical failures, and develop health check endpoints. Implement distributed tracing across integration points.

## 10. Develop Integration Testing Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3, 10.5, 10.7
### Description: Create a framework for testing external integrations
### Details:
Implement mock servers for external APIs, create test fixtures and scenarios, and develop integration test suites. Build a CI pipeline for integration tests and create a sandbox environment for manual testing.

## 11. Create Integration Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3, 10.5, 10.7, 10.8, 10.9, 10.10
### Description: Develop comprehensive documentation for all external integrations
### Details:
Document API client usage, queue job formats, webhook handling, configuration requirements, and monitoring capabilities. Create troubleshooting guides, integration diagrams, and developer onboarding materials. Maintain a catalog of all external service dependencies.
