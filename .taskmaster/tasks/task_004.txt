# Task ID: 4
# Title: Create Core Eloquent Models and Relationships
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement all Eloquent models with proper relationships, accessors, mutators, and business logic methods
# Details:
Create models:
1. User model (extend default with additional methods)
2. Employee model with belongsTo User relationship
3. Project model with financial calculation methods
4. Customer and Vendor models
5. ProjectAssignment model for many-to-many with pivot data
6. TimeEntry model with project associations
7. FinancialRecord model
Implement relationships:
- Employee belongsTo User
- Project belongsToMany Employee through ProjectAssignment
- Project belongsTo Customer
- TimeEntry belongsTo Employee and Project
- FinancialRecord belongsTo Project
Add model factories for testing and seeding

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for all model relationships, test model factories generate valid data, verify accessor/mutator functionality, test model validation rules, confirm cascade deletes work properly

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define core entity models [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify and implement all core entity models with their basic attributes and data types
### Details:
Create model classes for each core entity in the system. Define all necessary properties with appropriate data types, annotations, and access modifiers. Ensure proper encapsulation and follow naming conventions.

## 2. Implement model relationships [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Define all relationships between models (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many)
### Details:
Configure navigation properties and foreign keys for all entity relationships. Use appropriate ORM annotations/configurations to specify relationship types, cascade behaviors, and loading strategies.

## 3. Add validation rules [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Implement data validation rules for all model properties
### Details:
Add validation attributes or rules for each property (required fields, length restrictions, format validations, etc.). Implement custom validation logic where standard validation attributes are insufficient.

## 4. Implement business logic methods [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2
### Description: Add domain-specific business logic methods to each model
### Details:
Implement methods that encapsulate business rules and operations specific to each entity. This includes calculations, state transitions, and complex validations that involve multiple properties or related entities.

## 5. Create model factories [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3
### Description: Develop factory classes for generating test instances of each model
### Details:
Implement factory classes that can create valid instances of each model with realistic test data. Include options to customize specific properties and relationships for different test scenarios.

## 6. Write unit tests for models [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.3, 4.5
### Description: Create comprehensive unit tests for model properties and validation
### Details:
Write tests that verify property getters/setters, validation rules, and any simple methods. Ensure all validation rules are properly tested with both valid and invalid inputs.

## 7. Write unit tests for business logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.4, 4.5
### Description: Create tests for all business logic methods in the models
### Details:
Develop tests that verify the correctness of all business logic methods under various scenarios. Include edge cases and ensure proper handling of invalid inputs or states.

## 8. Test model relationships [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2, 4.5
### Description: Create integration tests to verify proper relationship configurations
### Details:
Write tests that verify the correct loading, saving, and cascading behavior of entity relationships. Test scenarios should include creating, updating, and deleting entities with various relationship configurations.
