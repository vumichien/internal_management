# Task ID: 4
# Title: Create Core Eloquent Models and Relationships
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement all Eloquent models with proper relationships, accessors, mutators, and business logic methods
# Details:
Create models:
1. User model (extend default with additional methods)
2. Employee model with belongsTo User relationship
3. Project model with financial calculation methods
4. Customer and Vendor models
5. ProjectAssignment model for many-to-many with pivot data

- FinancialRecord belongsTo Project
Add model factories for testing and seeding

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for all model relationships, test model factories generate valid data, verify accessor/mutator functionality, test model validation rules, confirm cascade deletes work properly

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define core entity models [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify and implement all core entity models with their basic attributes and data types
### Details:
Create model classes for each core entity in the system. Define all necessary properties with appropriate data types, annotations, and access modifiers. Ensure proper encapsulation and follow naming conventions.
<info added on 2025-06-03T13:50:39.655Z>
**COMPLETION STATUS: VERIFIED**

All core entity models have been successfully implemented and are already present in the codebase. The existing models demonstrate proper Laravel conventions with appropriate data types, fillable attributes, casts, and encapsulation. Each model includes comprehensive business logic methods and follows established naming conventions.

**Key Implementation Highlights:**
- All 8 core models are fully functional with proper class structure
- Models utilize Laravel traits (SoftDeletes, HasFactory, Notifiable) appropriately
- Fillable arrays are properly defined for mass assignment protection
- Data type casting is implemented for dates, arrays, and booleans
- Business logic methods provide essential functionality for each entity
- Auto-generation features are implemented where needed (e.g., employee IDs)

This subtask is complete and ready for the next phase of relationship implementation.
