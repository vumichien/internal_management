Google OAuth2 Configuration Complete

What was already in place:
- Laravel Socialite package already installed in composer.json
- Google OAuth2 configuration already present in config/services.php with proper redirect URL
- Environment variables GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET already defined in .env (though empty)

What I implemented:
- Created migration `2025_06_03_142348_add_social_auth_columns_to_users_table.php` to add social authentication columns
- Added `google_id` and `github_id` columns to users table with proper indexing
- Successfully ran the migration to update the database schema

Database Schema Updates:
- Added `google_id` (string, nullable) column after email
- Added `github_id` (string, nullable) column after google_id  
- Added indexes on both columns for performance
- User model already has these columns in fillable array

Configuration Status:
- Laravel Socialite installed
- Google OAuth2 configured in config/services.php
- Environment variables defined (need actual Google credentials)
- Database schema updated with social auth columns
- User model supports social authentication

Next Steps:
- Need to obtain actual Google OAuth2 credentials from Google Cloud Console
- Set GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET in .env file

Route verification completed successfully. All authentication routes are properly configured and functional:

Traditional auth routes (login, register, logout, password reset, email verification) are active from routes/auth.php with correct middleware (guest/auth/throttle/signed).

Social authentication routes for Google and GitHub are properly defined in routes/web.php with provider constraints and named routes (socialite.redirect, socialite.callback).

Confirmed via artisan route:list - all 27 routes registered correctly with appropriate HTTP methods, CSRF protection, and RESTful conventions. No additional routes required.
