For example, when a user is deleted, their employee record might be kept but with user_id set to NULL, while deleting a project might cascade to delete all its assignments and time entries.
<info added on 2025-06-03T10:53:21.944Z>
**Foreign Key Constraints Review and Implementation Status:**

All migrations have been created with comprehensive foreign key constraints and appropriate cascading rules. Here's the complete implementation status:

**1. Users Table Extensions:**
- No foreign keys needed (base table)
- Soft deletes implemented for data retention

**2. Employees Table:**
- `user_id` → `users.id` (CASCADE update, SET NULL delete) ✅
- `manager_id` → `employees.id` (CASCADE update, SET NULL delete) ✅
- Allows employee records to persist even if user account is deleted

**3. Projects Table:**
- `customer_id` → `customers.id` (CASCADE update, SET NULL delete) ✅
- `project_manager_id` → `employees.id` (CASCADE update, SET NULL delete) ✅
- Projects remain accessible even if customer/manager relationships change

**4. Customers Table:**
- `assigned_sales_rep` → `employees.id` (CASCADE update, SET NULL delete) ✅
- Customer records persist independently

**5. Vendors Table:**
- `assigned_procurement_rep` → `employees.id` (CASCADE update, SET NULL delete) ✅
- Vendor records persist independently

**6. Project Assignments Table:**
- `project_id` → `projects.id` (CASCADE update, CASCADE delete) ✅
- `employee_id` → `employees.id` (CASCADE update, CASCADE delete) ✅
- `assigned_by` → `users.id` (CASCADE update, SET NULL delete) ✅
- `approved_by` → `users.id` (CASCADE update, SET NULL delete) ✅
- Assignments are deleted when project/employee is deleted (business logic)

**7. Time Entries Table:**
- `employee_id` → `employees.id` (CASCADE update, CASCADE delete) ✅
- `project_id` → `projects.id` (CASCADE update, CASCADE delete) ✅
- `project_assignment_id` → `project_assignments.id` (CASCADE update, SET NULL delete) ✅
- `approved_by` → `users.id` (CASCADE update, SET NULL delete) ✅
- `created_by` → `users.id` (CASCADE update, SET NULL delete) ✅
- `updated_by` → `users.id` (CASCADE update, SET NULL delete) ✅
- `locked_by` → `users.id` (CASCADE update, SET NULL delete) ✅
- Time entries deleted with project/employee but preserve audit trail for users

**8. Financial Records Table:**
- `project_id` → `projects.id` (CASCADE update, CASCADE delete) ✅
- `created_by` → `users.id` (CASCADE update, RESTRICT delete) ✅
- `approved_by` → `users.id` (CASCADE update, SET NULL delete) ✅
- Financial records require creator preservation (RESTRICT) but allow approver changes

**Cascading Strategy Implemented:**
- **CASCADE DELETE**: Used for dependent records that have no meaning without parent (assignments, time entries, financial records with projects)
- **SET NULL DELETE**: Used where relationship is important but record should persist (employee-user, manager relationships, approval relationships)
- **RESTRICT DELETE**: Used for critical audit trails (financial record creators)
- **CASCADE UPDATE**: Used universally to maintain referential integrity

**Polymorphic Relationships:**
- Financial records support polymorphic relationships to customers, vendors, employees via `related_entity_type` and `related_entity_id`
- No foreign key constraints on polymorphic fields (by design)

**Soft Deletes:**
- All major entities support soft deletes for data retention
- Foreign key constraints work properly with soft deleted records

All foreign key constraints have been properly implemented with business-appropriate cascading rules. The database schema maintains referential integrity while preserving important audit trails and business relationships.

## 10. Create Database Seeders for Testing and Development [done]
### Dependencies: 2.9
### Description: Implement comprehensive database seeders for all tables to facilitate testing and development
### Details:
Create database seeders for all tables with realistic test data. Include a main DatabaseSeeder that coordinates all individual seeders in the correct order respecting foreign key constraints. Create factory classes for each model to generate random but realistic data. Implement different seeding environments (minimal, standard, comprehensive) for different development needs. Ensure seeders can be run repeatedly without errors by checking for existing data.
<info added on 2025-06-03T13:48:22.916Z>
Database seeding implementation completed successfully with comprehensive test coverage. Created DatabaseSeeder that coordinates all individual seeders in proper order respecting foreign key constraints. Implemented factory classes for all models generating realistic test data. Successfully seeded 18 users, 23 employees, 34 customers, 23 vendors, 4 projects, 12 project assignments, 498 time entries, and 104 financial records. Created comprehensive FactoryTest.php with 9 test methods covering individual and combined factory testing, verifying proper database insertion and field validation with all 43 assertions passing. All 12 migrations applied successfully with foreign key constraints properly implemented. Factory relationships working correctly including User->Employee and Customer->Project associations. Database schema implementation is complete and fully functional.
