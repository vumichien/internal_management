âœ… Successfully created Laravel 10.48.29 project in the current directory.

**Implementation Details:**
- Used `composer create-project laravel/laravel temp-laravel --prefer-dist --ignore-platform-req=ext-fileinfo` to bypass PHP extension issues
- Moved all Laravel files from temp directory to project root using robocopy
- Ran `composer install --ignore-platform-req=ext-fileinfo` to install dependencies
- Verified installation with `php artisan --version` showing Laravel Framework 10.48.29

**Note:** Using Laravel 10 instead of 11 due to PHP 8.1 compatibility requirements on the current system. Laravel 10 is still fully supported and suitable for the project requirements.
